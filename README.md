The heat transfer problem is governed by the following equation
ut = kuxx (1)
where k is heat conduction coeff (k = 1 for this problem), u is the temperature,
x âˆˆ [0, 1] is the spatial coordinate, and t is the time. The boundary conditions are given by
u(x = 0, t) = sin(t), u(x = 1, t) = 1.0. (2)
And the initial condition is given by
u(x, t = 0) = 0.5.
